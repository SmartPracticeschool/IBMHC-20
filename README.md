# SBSPS-Challenge-1624-Sentiment-Analysis-of-COVID-19-Tweets-Visualization-Dashboard
The sentiment analysis of Indians after the extension of lockdown announcements to be analyzed with the relevant #tags on twitter and build a predictive analytics model to understand the behavior of people if the lockdown is further extended.
Also develop a dashboard with visualization of people's reaction to the government announcements on lockdown extension.

Develop a twitter sentiment analysis model to understand the following:
1. Get to know people’s sentiment towards the epidemic
2. Understand the sentiments of people in the government. decision to extend the lockdown

 **Overview**
- The Covid-19 has been endangering the public safety and the government has been imposing
lockdowns to tackle it. But, the lockdown has its own effects on the public and they have
their own reactions and thoughts on the same. Social media platforms such as Twitter act as
a host to honest reviews by the public, hence it can be used for a better collection of the
public opinion and come up with a better solution.
Hence, our aim is to develop a Twitter Sentiment Analysis Visualization dashboard,
depicting various public sentiments (on twitter) in India during the lockdown.
The sentiments of the Indian public after the announcement of lockdown to be analyzed with
the relevant #tags on twitter and a predictive analytics model to be built to understand the
public behavior if the lockdown is further extended

**Purpose**
- Fighting the coronavirus not only needs the guidance from the government but also a
positive attitude from the public. Our analysis provides a potential approach to reveal the
public’s sentiment status and help institutions respond timely to it.The purpose of this project
is to analyze tweets for the lockdown due to covid-19 and understand the sentiments of
people to know how are they taking this lockdown personally and how would they react if
this continues.
- This study would help organizations to understand one's mental state during the initial stage
of lockdown to the state they currently possess, also better understand the situation and its
impact on people more accurately for which they need not have any prior knowledge of
coding. This would enable organizations to adjust accordingly before occurrence of any
serious damage and help them come up with better ideas to enhance and promote their
business or make better policies.
The above solution can be further applied to analyse racism, hatred, bullying like sentiments
present in the tweets, so that they can be removed and prevented from spreading such
sentiments further and cause harm to the feelings of a community or basically other
humans.These visualizations would help authorities to make appropriate decisions based on
current situations for different domains

**CONCLUSION**
- This project gave us the analytical conclusion on the sentiments expressed in the tweets by
people on the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This made use of the IBM Watson
tools, NLP technologies and Machine learning algorithms and the results were visualized
on a dashboard depicting the overall public opinion (positive, negative, neutral) on the
current lockdown situation, which will help us further predict their reaction, if the
lockdown is extended.
- Comparisons were made on the recent public opinion and the opinion during the initial
phases of lockdown (late March).
- During the initial phase, the score of positive reactions is more than that of the other
sentiments. Hence, initially the public was strongly in support of the lockdown. But,
observations from the recent analysis show decrease in the positive sentiment score i.e. the
public support not against but has decreased a bit due to factors such as economic
slowdown, job losses, food shortage etc.
- "Covid19" was the trending word and according to the visualizations (frequency analysis
graphs) , it shows that the overall reaction represents the opinion of the majority of public.
- A dashboard has been created, depicting all the above visualizations.
